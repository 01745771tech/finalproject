        <p>
            What I learned about joining this class is that, thanks to you Instructor, I found out sooner than later that coding is what excites me most about computers. 
            So my career path with be about coding. I hope to find a non profit or company that we invests in me to get experience and knowledge to help me achieve the 
            most out of college and the future of my career.
