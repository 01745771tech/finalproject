    <p>
        What I learned about joining this class is that, thanks to you professor, I found out sooner than later that coding is what excites me most about computers. 
        So my career path with be about coding. I hope to find a non profit or company that we invests in me to get experience and knowledge to help me achieve the 
        most out of college and the future of  my career.
